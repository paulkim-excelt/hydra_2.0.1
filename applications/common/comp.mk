#   To achieve the functionality needed for demonstration of chip capabilities in
#   a user perceivable manner, this layer of software in architecture is responsible for
#       -# configuring components appropriately
#       -# additional tasks needed to control the application for user experience
#       .
#
#   Configuration includes both build time and runtime configurations. Applications
#   are also responsible for take appropriate actions based on input events like
#       -# link up/down notifications starting/stopping the media system (in applicable platforms)
#       -# controlling switch functionality based on link up/down or dataflow monitoring
