#   @section sec_circq_overview Overview
#   This Module contains requirements, Interface, Design
#   and implementation details of Circular Queues.
#   <BR>Circular Queues are intented to be used by logging,
#   media framework and media components extensively.
#
#   Circular Queue provides the following features:
#       -# Macros to define and initialize a CIRCQ (overwrite/non-overwrite mode in #CIRCQ)
#       -# APIs to check if CIRCQ is empty or full
#       -# APIs to push/pop to/from the CIRCQ
#       -# API to peek into the CIRCQ
#       .
#   @todo update state machine and sequence diagram
#   @limitations Maximum number of objects in the queue is limited to 65536 and
#                shall be in powers of 2.
